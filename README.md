# **Mini Project - Retail Sales Intelligence & Customer Insight Analytics**


This Power BI mini project analyzes a retail sales dataset to uncover business insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, profitability, discount impact, and operational efficiency. The project includes data cleaning, modeling, DAX calculations, KPIs, and interactive dashboards across multiple pages. It provides insights into sales trends, customer behavior, profitability drivers, shipping performance, and discount impact using advanced Power BI visualizations and AI-driven analytics.






## **DATA SET**


The dataset is a consumer retail sales dataset sourced from OpenDataBay. It contains detailed transactional records of customer purchases, product information, shipping details, and financial metrics. The data is similar to a real-world retail environment and is suitable for sales analysis, customer segmentation, profitability evaluation, and operational insights.






## **PROJECT GOALS**


•	Analyze overall retail performance by studying sales, profit, and order trends over time.


•	Understand customer behavior using metrics such as AOV (Average Order Value) and CLV (Customer Lifetime Value).


•	Identify key product insights by evaluating top- and bottom-performing categories and sub-categories.


•	Measure the impact of discounts on profit to determine optimal pricing and discount strategies.


•	Assess regional performance to identify high-performing and low-performing markets.


•	Evaluate shipping efficiency using shipping days, ship mode, and estimated shipping cost.


•	Differentiate between new and repeat customers and understand their contribution to revenue.


•	Leverage Power BI AI visuals (Key Influencers & Smart Narrative) to uncover hidden insights and patterns.


•	Build an interactive Power BI dashboard with slicers, drill-through, page navigation, and KPIs.


•	Present a clean, insightful PDF report summarizing all important findings for stakeholders.





## **TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES USED**


•	Power BI Desktop: Data modeling, cleaning, DAX, dashboards, visualizations, PDF export


•	Power Query: Data transformation, duplicates removal, calculated fields

## **KEY FINDINGS**


This analysis highlights key trends and performance drivers across sales, customer segments, and operations.


•	 **Financial & Sales Highlights**


-Top Performance: The Technology category drives the highest sales, with the overall sales trend showing continued positive growth through 2024.


-Profit Drivers: Phones and Copiers are top-tier products, generating both high sales and high profit. Conversely, Tables and Bookcases are significant profit detractors, showing losses despite recorded sales.


-Profit Risk: Profit is negatively influenced by high discounts; the average profit decreases sharply when the Sum of Discount is greater than 0.4.


•	 **Customer & Loyalty**


-CLV & AOV: The total Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is 2.30M, with an Average Order Value (AOV) of 458.56.


-Segmentation: The Consumer segment constitutes the largest customer base at 51.95%, and along with Corporate, it yields the highest CLV, particularly in the East region.


-Retention: Customer retention is strong, with 99.1% of customers flagged as repeat buyers.


•	 **Operational Efficiency**


-Shipping Costs: Standard Class shipping incurs the highest total cost while also having the longest lead time, averaging 5.01 days.


-Fastest Mode: Same Day shipping is the most efficient option, averaging only 0.04 days.
